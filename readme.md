Mario's Booster Hunt

This is a 3D, turn-based strategy game where you must guide Mario to the goal tile while avoiding bombs and outsmarting zombies.

How to Run the Game

To play, you must have all four game files in the same directory:

index.html (The home page)

mario_game_v2.html (The game itself)

super-mario-character-4k-kl-3840x2160.jpg (Image asset)

mario - QuickSounds.com.mp3 (Audio asset)

Once all files are in the same folder, just open the index.html file in your web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari). Click the "Play Game" button to start.

How to Play

Goal: Reach the red "Goal" tile without running out of lives.

Controls: Click a difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard) to begin the game.

Optimal AI: Hold the Spacebar to make Mario use his "Optimal AI," which weighs the goal, zombie distance, and booster distance to find the best path.

Zombies: Move at 75% speed (3 out of 4 turns) and will chase you.

Bombs (Purple): These are obstacles that block both you and the zombies.

Boosters (Yellow): Collecting a booster gives you +1 Life and +1 Booster (Shield).

Getting Caught:

With a Booster: You use the booster to kill the zombie, lose 0 lives, and continue from that spot.

Without a Booster: You lose 1 life and respawn at the start.

Game Over: The game ends when your "Lives" count reaches 0.
